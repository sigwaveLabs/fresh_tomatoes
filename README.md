# Fresh Tomatoes
![](https://github.com/sigwaveLabs/fresh_tomatoes/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes_screen_shot.png)


This project was created as part of my coursework for the Udacity [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). The project is a basic website that contains information about my favorite movies. The youtube movie trailer will pop-up and play when the movies are clicked. The goal of this project is to show how to use classes in python to create instances by passinging in parameters.
