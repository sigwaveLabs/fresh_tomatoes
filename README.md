# Fresh Tomatoes


This project was created as part of my coursework for the Udacity [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). The project is a basic website that contains information about my favorite movies. The youtube movie trailer will pop-up and play when the movies are clicked.
